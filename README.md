# Macbook Air 2015 Arch Setup

Linux is fantastic on a Macbook Air. Whether you're dual-booting or triple-booting, having a complete setup is a necessity.

These are some helpful tweaks to get an installed system with GNOME 3 running as best as it can (if you're not running GNOME 3, you'll have to modify xbindkeysrc to suit your desktop environment). 

These tweaks include:

- Better touchpad configuration with mtrack
- Familiar macOS-like touchpad gestures using xbindkeys in GNOME 3
- Powertop auto-tuning
- Wifi driver install + bug workaround
- Facetime HD driver install
- Keyboard tilde fix


### Installing

For best results, connect your Macbook Air to the internet via Bluetooth or USB tethering before running the script. If this is not an option, you can simply install the broadcom-wl-dkms package manually via USB.

Simply run the setup.sh script, reboot and you're done! Once finished, your system should be nice and polished.

This is mainly for easy setup, but some may find it useful. Of course, please read the wiki's Mac page for the details, you might want to know how to do this manually as well.
